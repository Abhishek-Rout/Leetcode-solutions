# Separate Black and White Balls

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` of length `n`, where:
- `1` represents a black ball
- `0` represents a white ball

The goal is to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the left by swapping adjacent balls. 

Return the minimum number of steps required to achieve this.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** 
```plaintext
s = "101"
```
**Output:** 
```plaintext
1
```
**Explanation:** 
We can group all the black balls to the right by swapping `s[0]` and `s[1]`:
- Swap: `s[0]` and `s[1]` → `s = "011"`
Thus, it takes 1 step to group the black balls.

### Example 2
**Input:** 
```plaintext
s = "100"
```
**Output:** 
```plaintext
2
```
**Explanation:** 
To group all the black balls to the right:
1. Swap `s[0]` and `s[1]` → `s = "010"`
2. Swap `s[1]` and `s[2]` → `s = "001"`

It takes a minimum of 2 steps to group the black balls.

### Example 3
**Input:** 
```plaintext
s = "0111"
```
**Output:** 
```plaintext
0
```
**Explanation:** 
All the black balls are already grouped to the right, requiring 0 steps.

## Constraints

- 1 <=n == s.length <= 10^5
- `s.length == n`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, follow these steps:

1. **Count Black Balls**: Count the number of `1`s in the string, which represent the black balls.
2. **Calculate Swaps**: For each black ball encountered, calculate how many swaps are needed to move it to the rightmost position by keeping track of how many white balls (0s) are to the left of it.
3. **Total Steps**: Sum the calculated swaps to get the total number of steps required.

## Implementation

You may implement the solution in your preferred programming language using the outlined approach to find the minimum number of steps to separate the black and white balls.
