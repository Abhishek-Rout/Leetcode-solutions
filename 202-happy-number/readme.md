1. The function checks if a number is a **happy number** by breaking it down into the __sum of the squares of its digits.__

2. There’s a helper function called __get_sum_of_squares__ that takes a number and adds up the squares of each of its digits.

3. I used a list called **seen** to keep track of the numbers I’ve already come across, so I can check if I'm stuck in a loop.

4. The main loop keeps running until n becomes 1. If it becomes 1, the number is happy.

5. In every loop, I update n by replacing it with the sum of the squares of its digits.

6. The function returns True if the number eventually reaches 1.

7. If program notice that a number keeps repeating (it’s in the seen list), program return False because it will never reach 1.

8. The list **seen** helps me avoid infinite loops by remembering what numbers I’ve already checked.

9. The goal is to either reach 1 (happy number) or find a loop (not happy).
